**Problem 1**
## a.
I could calculate the mean number of steps I took each day to compare average step counts between days when I had class and days when I didnâ€™t, because I think I walk more on days I have class because I walk between classes and from my bike. I could also compare the mean number of steps based on the type of exercise I did, since I expect activities like running to result in more steps than yoga or rest days.
